 In this project I have build a banking app which handles login, Transfer amounts, Get Loan amount and Close account features with updating UI. I've got some hands-on practice in JavaScript fundamentals, DOM Manipulation, Arrays, Array Methods, Numbers, Dates, Intl, setTimeout, setInterval, Modal Window, Event Handling, Firebase, HTML5 and CSS3. In this Project I have build a banking app which handles login, Transfer amounts, Get Loan amount and Close account features with updating UI.
